Our objective is to create a chatbot that can run a credit application to test credit worthiness and suggest different credit cards or loans to users

- Use data from Kaggle for credit application information
- Using Amazon SageMaker, train and split test data to find best models. Use visualization to evaluate performance.
- Using Amazon Lex build chatbot eg: Intent, utterances, slots etc
- Use Lambda to input data into chatbot 
- Create presentation showcasing the model and the chatbot in use
